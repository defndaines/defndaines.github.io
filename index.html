      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Software engineer based in the Los Angeles area.</p>

      <p>I have two kids who I enjoy spending time with. I love music,
      traveling, food, reading, guitar, and exploring.</p>

      <h2>Reading</h2>

      <p>I read a lot. It’s my main hobby, honestly.</p>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/defndaines/kiroku">記録</a>
      I have a GitHub repository that’s devoted almost entirely to tracking my
      reading, including my TBR, lists of awards I pay attention to, and
      favorite authors I’ve read.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/defndaines/">defndaines @ Instagram</a>
      I primarily use Instagram for posting my weekly reading wrap-ups. These
      include short reviews.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6142552-michael-daines">goodreads</a><br>
      I keep track of books I’ve read here, including graphic novels.</p>

      <p><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/daines">The StoryGraph</a>
      I’ve also been tracking books here, but as of 2025, I’m limiting
      StoryGraph to just my non-graphic reading.</p>

      <p><a href="https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/profile/daines/">League of Comic Geeks</a><br>
      I tracked comics on Goodreads for a while, but then it looks like I’m
      reading hundreds of more books that I really feel like I am, so I’ve
      started tracking my individual issues here. I’ll still tracking graphic
      novels on Goodreads. I get my comics from
      <a href="https://www.thecomicbug.com/">The Comic Bug</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="https://bookmeter.com/users/972193">読書メーター</a><br>
      When I have the energy to read in Japanese, I track it on my profile at
      bookmeter.</p>

      <h2>Active Links</h2>

      <p>Here are a few relevant links for finding out more about me and my
      hobbies.</p>

      I don’t code in my free time as much as I used to, but it’s mostly on
      display under by GitHub account.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ax2groin">flickr photographs</a><br>

      <h2>Historical Links</h2>

      <p>These are links to things I’m not actively engaged with, but may be
      useful for reference.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-daines-1771272/">LinkedIn profile</a><br>
      I’m not looking for work, but I have kept my résumé “mostly” up to date.</p>

      <p><a href="https://community.wanikani.com/u/deinzu">WaniKani profile</a><br>
      Starting in 2017, I’ve been trying to rebuild my Japanese language
      skills. I used WaniKani regularly for learning and review and also
      participated in the community from time to time.</p>

      <p><a href="https://exercism.io/profiles/defndaines">exercism.io profile</a><br>
      When I want to tackle some smaller coding problems or practice a
      programming language, I like the problems at exercism. I tried to give
      back from time to time as well.</p>

      <p><a href="https://medium.com/@defndaines">Medium profile</a><br>
      I haven’t been blogging for some time now, but I used to post stuff on
      Medium.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mymccanns.com/recipe/mccanns-oatmeal-pancakes/">Oatmeal Pancakes Recipe</a><br>
      This is the best oatmeal pancake recipe I’ve found, but swap in whole
      milk and whole-fat yogurt.</p>
