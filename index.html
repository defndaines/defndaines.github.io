      <p>Here are a few relevant links for finding out more about me and my
      hobbies.</p>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/defndaines">GitHub: defndaines</a><br>
      I don't code in my free time as much as I used to, but it's mostly on
      display under by github account.</p>
      
      <p><a href="https://community.wanikani.com/u/daines">WaniKani profile</a><br>
      Since 2017, I've been trying to rebuild my Japanese language skills. I
      use WaniKani regularly for learning and review and also participate in
      the community from time to time.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ax2groin">flickr photographs</a><br>
      I keep any pictures I take up at flickr.</p>

      When I want to tackle some smaller coding problems or practice a
      programming language, I like the problems at exercism. I try to give back
      from time to time, too.</p>

      things I'd like to have.</p>
