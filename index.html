      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Software engineer based in the Los Angeles area.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.healthfinch.com/">healthfinch</a><br>
      I work at healthfinch on the Product team.</p>

      <p>I have two kids who I enjoy spending time with. I love to travel and
      explore.</p>

      <h2>Links</h2>
      
      <p>Here are a few relevant links for finding out more about me and my
      hobbies.</p>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/defndaines">GitHub: defndaines</a><br>
      I don't code in my free time as much as I used to, but it's mostly on
      display under by github account.</p>
      
      <p><a href="https://community.wanikani.com/u/daines">WaniKani profile</a><br>
      Since 2017, I've been trying to rebuild my Japanese language skills. I
      use WaniKani regularly for learning and review and also participate in
      the community from time to time.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6142552-michael-daines">goodreads</a><br>
      I like to read, and I keep track of books I've read here.</p>

      <p><a href="https://bookmeter.com/users/972193">読書メーター</a><br>
      I'm trying to read more in Japanese, and have a profile at bookmeter.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ax2groin">flickr photographs</a><br>
      I keep any pictures I take up at flickr.</p>

      <p><a href="https://exercism.io/profiles/defndaines">exercism.io profile</a><br>
      When I want to tackle some smaller coding problems or practice a
      programming language, I like the problems at exercism. I try to give back
      from time to time, too.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2B071NDZWAZPX">Amazon wishlist</a><br>
      If you've gotten this far and want to buy me something, I keep a list of
      things I'd like to have. I keep a separate list
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/R6BS0GASDTZQ">for the kids</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-daines-1771272/">LinkedIn profile</a><br>
      I'm not looking for work, but I have kept my résumé up to date.</p>

      I haven't been blogging for some time now, but I used to post stuff on
      Medium.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mymccanns.com/Recipe/mccanns-oatmeal-pancakes/">Oatmeal Pancakes Recipe</a><br>
      This is the best oatmeal pancake recipe I've found, but swap in whole
      milk and whole fat yogurt.</p>
