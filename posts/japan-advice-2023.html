      <h1>Advice for Japan: Children, Language, and Education</h1>

      <p>Summer 2023, we took the kids (12 and 9) to Japan for an extended stay
      that included four weeks in a Japanese-language school.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>I have been working remotely since 2017. Since 2022, I've been at a
      job which doesn't require me to be located in a limited set of time
      zones. This opened up the possibility of working from a different country
      while the kids attended a program during the day.</p>

      <p>My kids have both been in Japanese immersion from kindergarten. My
      daughter attended and my son still attends
      <a href="https://elmarino.ccusd.org/">El Marino Elementary</a>. This is
      entirely a second language, though; we do not have a native speaker at
      home. Because of this, I'd been thinking about ways to expose them to the
      language in a more extended, meaningful way.</p>

      <p>The plan was to spend three weeks vacationing and four weeks in a
      program. My wife joined us for the vacation portion, then returned home,
      since her job cannot be done remote. I stayed on with the children,
      renting a furnished apartment in Tokyo for five weeks. The kids would
      attend school during the day, while I comuted to a branch office to take
      advantage of more comfortable working environment.</p>

      <h2>The Program: Options</h2>

      <p>Being the first year since Japan opened up from Coronovirus, it was
      rather difficult to find programs. On top of this, most internet searches
      are focused on college or perhaps high-school aged attendees. I only
      found one program which offered Japanese language instruction for
      elementary and middle-school age children.</p>

      <p>Cheaper up to 11, 12 starts paying higher or ever adult prices for things.</p>

      <h2>Difficult to find activities </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>taiko, everyone is prepping for performance at end of July, only found private lessons</li>
        <li>Didn’t find music stores or practice spaces</li>
        <li>Swimming and difficult to get into clubs</li>
        <li>Look for monthly fee activities at Rex centers, like martial arts or soccer?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>NewIS</h2>
      <p>NewIS nice, but with other non-native speakers</p>
      <ul>
        <li>schedule not announced until end of March (during our Spring Break)</li>
        <li>Ran 2 2-week sessions in July and into August</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Laundry</h2>
      <p>Laundry, pack to just use machine as hamper and wash when ready.</p>

      <h2>Trash</h2>
      <p>Trash… other than obvious, just throw everything in burnable</p>

      <h2>Housing</h2>
      <p>Stops with fewer connections are quieter neighborhoods</p>
      <ul>
        <li>want groceries at or near station, on walk home</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Furnished apartments ( <a href="https://www.kaguaruoo.com/">KaguAruoo</a> )</p>

      <h2>Summer</h2>
      <p>Sunrise is 4:30 at Solstice</p>

      <p>Big rains with possible flooding in late June. Then 99F and high humidity in late July.</p>

      <h2>Netflix</h2>

      <h2>Phone</h2>
      <p>T-Mobile and oddities with time and region</p>

      <p>Online reservations and Japanese phone number</p>

      <h2>Google Maps</h2>
      <p>Google and poor results, but still easiest</p>
      <ul>
        <li>have to check settings, like trains AND buses. And if you develop habits, it sometimes doesn’t show shorter routes.</li>
        <li>Sometimes best to pick start station and navigate from there</li>
        <li>Restaurant and store information can be wrong. Several shops didn’t exist anymore. Hours sometimes wrong. Sometimes location navigation wrong</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Transit</h2>
      <p>Suica cards</p>

      <p>Long-term bicycle rental?</p>

      <p>Office cafeterias</p>

      <h2>Pocket WiFi</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>turn off when not needed</li>
        <li>Watch out for auto-uploads (like photo and video backups)</li>
        <li>If access to other Wi-Fi, download Netflix/D+ on those</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Recommendations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Imamura duck ramen</li>
        <li>Hojicha with warabi mochi in Suzukien Asakusa</li>
      </ul>

      Point cards?
      <ul>
        <li>at grocery store it meant immediate discounts</li>
        <li>If we’d gotten one for Gong Cha (boba) it would have rewarded us. (Also student price for select drinks.)</li>
      </ul>
