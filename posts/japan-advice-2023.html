        <li>schedule not announced until end of March (during our Spring Break)</li>
        <li>Ran 2 2-week sessions in July and into August</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Laundry</h2>

      <h2>Trash</h2>
      <p>Trash… other than obvious, just throw everything in burnable</p>

      <h2>Housing</h2>

      <p>Online reservations and Japanese phone number</p>

      <h2>Google Maps</h2>
      <p>Google and poor results, but still easiest</p>
      <ul>
        <li>have to check settings, like trains AND buses. And if you develop habits, it sometimes doesn’t show shorter routes.</li>
        <li>Sometimes best to pick start station and navigate from there</li>
        <li>Restaurant and store information can be wrong. Several shops didn’t exist anymore. Hours sometimes wrong. Sometimes location navigation wrong</li>
