      <h1>Advice for Japan: Children, Language, and Education</h1>

      <p>Summer 2023, we took the kids (12 and 9) to Japan for an extended stay
      that included four weeks in a Japanese-language school.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>I have been working remotely since 2017. Since 2022, I've been at a
      job which doesn't require me to be located in a limited set of time
      zones. This opened up the possibility of working from a different country
      while the kids attended a program during the day.</p>

      <p>My kids have both been in Japanese immersion from kindergarten. My
      daughter attended and my son still attends
      <a href="https://elmarino.ccusd.org/">El Marino Elementary</a>. This is
      entirely a second language, though; we do not have a native speaker at
      home. Because of this, I'd been thinking about ways to expose them to the
      language in a more extended, meaningful way.</p>

      <p>The plan was to spend three weeks vacationing and four weeks in a
      program. My wife joined us for the vacation portion, then returned home,
      since her job cannot be done remote. I stayed on with the children,
      renting a furnished apartment in Tokyo for five weeks. The kids would
      attend school during the day, while I comuted to a branch office to take
      advantage of more comfortable working environment.</p>

      <h2>The Program Options</h2>

      <p>Being the first year since Japan opened up from Coronovirus, it was
      rather difficult to find programs. On top of this, most internet searches
      are focused on college or perhaps high-school aged attendees. I only
      found one program which offered Japanese language instruction for
      elementary and middle-school age children. (A second program existed last
      year at Yoyogi, but they decided not to run it this year, a decision not
      announced until late March.)</p>

      <h3>Japanese Public School</h3>

      <p><strong>Best Option</strong> If you have a native Japanese speaker in
      the home, or if you have access to someone who can advocate for you in
      fluent Japanese, the best option is to attend a local, public school in
      Japan for the end of their first semester. Typical Japanese schools run
      through late July and then have a long summer break (this year the last
      day of classes was Thursday 2023-07-20). (Note: "international" schools
      often run on a different calendar.)</p>

      <p>This option involves communicating directly with the school to get
      permission to attend, along with having a local address. For students at
      El Marino who have family in Japan (aunts, grandparents), this typically
      means staying with family and walking to the local school. It is also
      possible to rent an apartment/house near a school. With this option, you
      will need to buy some equipment, like gym clothes, that is required of
      all students. This option allows you to live wherever in Japan you like,
      provided you find a school willing to accept your children for June–July
      attendance (not all will).</p>

      <p>The distinct advantage of this approach is full immersion. They will
      be attending with children who speak Japanese fluently. They will be
      forced to interact with children daily at their own level. If this is
      possible for you, don't even consider any other options.</p>

      <p>One disadvantage to this option is that you'll be in Japan during the
      rainiest time of the year
      (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_rainy_season">梅雨</a>).</p>

      <h3>Japanese-language Instruction</h3>

      <p>The only program we could find in 2023 was at
      <a href="https://summer.newis.ed.jp/">New International School</a>. They
      ran a program from Thursday 6 July until Friday 4 August, with the
      options of attending only the first two, only the last two weeks, or all
      four weeks. (Note: The national holiday, Marine Day, is the third Monday
      in July.) They announced the schedule for their program in late March, so
      we literally found out about program options while we were out of town
      for Spring break.</p>

      <p>This school was fun for the kids, but be aware that they will be in
      class with other foreign kids who are also learning Japanese. It's
      possible your children will be among the most advanced speakers in class.
      There are Japanese kids attending the school, but in different programs,
      and interaction is limited. The second session falls during summer
      vacation for Japanese schools, so attendance in those programs spike.</p>

      <p>The school is located in (Minami) Ikebukuro. It's convenient to several train
      lines. The Metropolitan exit of Ikebukuro Station is directly west of the
      school. Higashi-Ikebukuro Station is close by, with subway access via the
      Yurakucho Line. And Toden-Zoshigaya Station is on the same street as the
      school and a quaint station on the Toden-Arakawa Line.</p>

      <h2>When to Go</h2>

      <p>By this, I mean, what age for your kids? It's going to be more
      fruitful after a couple years of immersion. After the 2nd grade, many
      kids will know enough basic kanji that place names will start to make
      sense. Transit and entrance prices are cheaper up to 11 in Japan. At age
      12, they start paying higher or ever adult prices for things. For
      example, train fare is half-price for kids 11 and under. (At 6 and under, a
      lot of things will be free.) Japan is an incredible opportunity for
      independence (ref.
      <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/how-is-old-enough-made">Old Enough!</a>
      [aka, はじめてのおつかい]). Japan is one of the safest countries in the
      world. My kids had Suica cards and commuted to and from school on the
      Yamanote line (two stops) by themselves.</p>

      <p><strong>Weather</strong> Most of Japan experiences heavy rainfall
      through mid-July. Depending upon where you are in Japan, this can also
      mean flooding. Then starting in July, temperatures climb into the 90s
      (Fahrenheit) and will stay that way until the end of August. It was
      common for Tokyo to be in the high 90s with 60% humidity in late July.
      Typhoon season peaks in August and September.</p>

      <p>Be aware that Sunrise was before 4:30 a.m. on the Solstice. Keep this
      in mind when apartment hunting and planning your days.</p>

      <h2>Housing</h2>

      <p>For us, we wanted something easy to commute to Ikebukuro. Because of
      the length of our stay, we were able to rent an apartment for five weeks,
      which is a different category of search from short-term rentals. There
      are a number of sites for furnished apartments which require a minimum
      one-month stay. We found our place through
      <a href="https://www.kaguaruoo.com/">KaguAruoo</a>. It was a two-bedroom
      in Komagome, just a five minute walk to Sugamo Station.</p>

      <h3>Laundry</h3>

      <p>You absolutely need an apartment with a washer. Likewise, be sure to
      pack light and only pack clothes that can be washed together. Just use
      the machine in your unit as a hamper and wash when ready. This is no
      joke, I packed six pairs of socks and underwear for seven weeks; you do
      laundry every 3–4 days. Quick-dry clothes are ideal, and you'll develop a
      routine to run laundry during breakfast or after returning from school,
      then hang up to dry.</p>

      <h3>Neighborhood</h3>

      <p>We really lucked out with Sugamo. There was a large grocery/department
      store (Seiyu) next to the station where we bought all of our breakfast
      and lunch supplies. There was a summer festival one weekend, just south
      of the station. And the following weekend an Obon festival at the nearby
      temple. No shortage of good restaurants around.</p>

      <p>My observation was that train stops with fewer connections tend to be
      quieter neighborhoods. Look for that and the proximity to a grocery
      store (sometimes the store is in the station).</p>

      <h3>Trash</h3>

      <p>Trash in Tokyo was complicated… Other than obvious, just throw
      everything in burnable. Paper, glass, and cans are easy to track and
      recycle. If you are cooking, the meat trays have their own day to take
      out. Plastic is the most confusing, with PET bottles being the only
      obviously recyclable ones. (This actually maps to the reality that 95% of
      plastic doesn't get recycled.)</p>

      <h2>Difficult to find activities </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>taiko, everyone is prepping for performance at end of July, only found private lessons</li>
        <li>Didn’t find music stores or practice spaces</li>
        <li>Swimming and difficult to get into clubs</li>
        <li>Look for monthly fee activities at Rex centers, like martial arts or soccer?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Netflix</h2>

      <h2>Phone</h2>
      <p>T-Mobile and oddities with time and region</p>

      <p>Online reservations and Japanese phone number</p>

      <h2>Google Maps</h2>
      <p>Google and poor results, but still easiest</p>
      <ul>
        <li>have to check settings, like trains AND buses. And if you develop habits, it sometimes doesn’t show shorter routes.</li>
        <li>Sometimes best to pick start station and navigate from there</li>
        <li>Restaurant and store information can be wrong. Several shops didn’t exist anymore. Hours sometimes wrong. Sometimes location navigation wrong</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Transit</h2>
      <p>Suica cards</p>

      <p>Long-term bicycle rental?</p>

      <p>Office cafeterias</p>

      <h2>Pocket WiFi</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>turn off when not needed</li>
        <li>Watch out for auto-uploads (like photo and video backups)</li>
        <li>If access to other Wi-Fi, download Netflix/D+ on those</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Recommendations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Imamura duck ramen</li>
        <li>Hojicha with warabi mochi in Suzukien Asakusa</li>
      </ul>

      Point cards?
      <ul>
        <li>at grocery store it meant immediate discounts</li>
        <li>If we’d gotten one for Gong Cha (boba) it would have rewarded us. (Also student price for select drinks.)</li>
      </ul>
