4. Fortress of Louisbourg National Historic Site

Welcome to the Fortress of Louisbourg National Historic Site, a magical place
on the edge of a continent where past and present come together to celebrate
Canada’s diverse heritage. Please note that we have three seasons throughout
the year: Low season Opportunities to experience the Fortress of Louisbourg's
quiet streets during the low season allow visitors to imagine life in the
toughest of conditions almost 300 years ago. While there are no services
available, a low season visit may provide the best opportunity for visitors to
experience the stillness of the streets, take in the beauty of the exterior
architecture of the buildings, or simply enjoy the treasures that life's
quietest moments may bring. For a new way to experience the site in the low
season, try our Explora app. Through sound, video, photos, quizzes and text,
you will hold stories about Louisbourg in your hands as you walk through both
the reconstructed town and the fortress's ruins. Explora is available to
download for free at the App Store and through Google Play. Shoulder season For
those seeking quiet opportunities and some on-site services, visiting during
the shoulder season is recommended. Visitors have the opportunity to enjoy an
inspiring setting with beautiful visuals as they stand on our history-laden
grounds. Several buildings with exhibits are open for you to discover. Explore
the site on your own or embark on an Explora tour of the grounds. To enhance
your visit you may purchase a guided tour or participate in the Time Travel
program. Accessible guided tours are available as well. We recommend reserving
a place on these tours in advance. By the end of June, the site will begin to
fill with costumed interpreters as we ramp up for peak season. After Labour
Day, the Fortress of Louisbourg winds down once again with costumed animators
interpreting some buildings into September. No matter the season, be sure to
find out from reception what activities and experiences may be on offer that
day. Peak Season Peak season brings a different kind of magic on-site as
costumed people add life to the streets and the homes. A foggy day cloaks the
site in mystery and creates scenes and images not to be forgotten. A cold day
with wind and rain may draw visitors to the warmth of a welcoming fire or to
the cozy inn for a warming bowl of soup. A hot day shows the town and its
various gardens at their brightest. On summer feast days colour and pageantry
break the routine of daily life as the townspeople promenade in their finery.
Chores are the order of the day on summer and fall mornings. With the rooster's
crow comes bread from the ovens that supplies both soldiers and hungry
visitors. Louisbourg's inhabitants are happy to share their stories, and can be
found working the forge, tending the gardens and running the kitchens. The beat
of drums and the chime of the garrison clock order the soldiers' day. The sound
of a cannon marks midday. You can even fire a cannon or musket yourself by
taking part in our 'Have a Blast' or 'Have a Ball' programs. Music might be
heard from a waterfront tavern. Children play games in the streets, while the
sentry at the gate challenges those who wish to enter the walled town. A public
punishment gathers spectators. Sheep run through the streets, called home by
the stable hand. Each hour offers something unique and real. During the peak
season you can immerse yourself in an 18th century dining experience, available
daily, at the Hotel de la Marine and Grandchamp House. For those who prefer a
modern experience L'Epee Royale Cafe offers a cozy stop for hot and cold
beverages and a variety of pastries. Groups can pre-arrange a dining experience
by calling 902-733-3552. The daily fare varies with the season. Please check in
